The UI is user friendly with icons and guiding dialog boxes wherever needed. MyNote begins with a splashscreen for 4.5 seconds, in which a gif animation I made pops up on screen.

The next step will be to add Find and Replace feature. A record of files recently edited needs to be kept. Other features will be added in subsequent commits.
